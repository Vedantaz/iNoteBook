Advantage of nodemon using>>
node index.js can be also written but , using the nodemon > we can directly use node index.js  command just by saving the file .

mongo : a command line tool sstarted 
mongod: an command to start and utilised mongo 
it is based on bson (more efficient than json) , similar to json ,
mongoose: abstraction layer on top of mongoDB
our connection string : mongodb://localhost:27017/?readPreference=primary&appname=MongoDB%20Compass&ssl=false

error: 
 # ReferenceError: Cannot access 'mongoose' before initialization
 # SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module
soln : 😂😂🤣 just we change the lines we should wriite :
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
then we shou;d write > const { Schema } = mongoose;
but we just exchange thew serial no. pof lines .. thats why that error is coming .

MongooseError: Operation `users.insertOne()` buffering timed out after 10000ms
MongooseError: Operation `users.createIndex()` buffering timed out after 10000ms
soln :
here we had created mongoose.conect function but unfortunately giving an error of  mongodb.insertOne() buffered timed out. 
then we created catch and then function but now it is giving an error : MongooseServerSelectionError: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:27017
Now we are creating the database using powershell or we can use cmd also .

............................................      SOLUTION GOT      😂😁😁😁😂..............................................
 CURED THE ERROR : simply by writing mongodb://127.0.0.1/inotebook   over mongodb://localhost:27017/inotebook
serarching the soln very days gone ,,, but searching still on 


## if you can't see the database ceated in the powershell or else things 
soln :minm 1 collection should be there in the database .

collections > documents > rows in database
mongoDB > collection > documents > fields  :  SQL/MYSQL > tables> rows > columns

# MongoParseError: option usecreateindex is not supported  : remove  useCreateIndex: true,
