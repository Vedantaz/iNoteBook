Heyyy starting it ....
1. error : export 'Switch' (imported as 'Switch') was not found in 'react-router-dom':
soln :   
If you using newer version of react-router-dom (ex. ^6.2.1 in my case) you should change <Switch> to <Routes> and use <Route> with component={<SampleComponent />} parameter.

2. error : 
Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported
soln :

# Some top answers did not work.
# export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
  And some top answers were not applicable, modifying package.json file:

# "start": "react-scripts --openssl-legacy-provider start"
  This is caused by the latest node.js V17 compatible issues with OpenSSL, see this and this issue on GitHub.

# 
To fix the dependency tree, try following the steps below in the exact order:

  1. Delete package-lock.json (not package.json!) and/or yarn.lock in your project folder.
  2. Delete node_modules in your project folder.
  3. Remove "babel-jest" from dependencies and/or devDependencies in the package.json file in your project folder.
  4. Run npm install or yarn, depending on the package manager you use.
# 
If nothing else helps, add SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to an .env file in your project.
That would permanently disable this preflight check in case you want to proceed anyway.

 solved the rror of not connectin with delete, add, update and getNotes..
 try to see evry connecting code and especially spelloin of each :
 1. In add > I not kept it PUT method , instaed I wrote OPST , > reson foir not working  or showing 404, 401 and 500 error.

 2. delete > Check the auth-token spelling correctly, and auth-token value is correct or not . 
 then I not done to setNotes in add, thtas's why it;s not getting I think. > reson for error.
 
 3. update > here the update function in notes.js, noteitem.js and notestate.js is written wrong, 
 i.e it's spelling is wrong , updatenote is given , but updateNote we want. 

 ######## THAT PARTICULAR CAST OBJECTID FAILED ERROR :
  Is due to culprit const note ={} in the noTESTATE UPTO VIDEO NO. 68
  we have to delete it and write const note =- json , we got from generating the
  dynamic note. 

  # Some-how don't know but login and sign-up page is not working , but code is correct / every thing is correct. > 
   Just error : is when i wrote e.preventDefault() ; code then I don't write the e argument in the function ....ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚  

  error: 
# Uncaught TypeError: react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_9___default is not a function or its return value is not iterable
soln:
    This is because useState is not the default export from the react package.
    To import specific modules from a package you should use the curly brace syntax. Try using import { useState } from 'react';

5. The pattern attribute is an attribute of the text, tel, email, url, password, and search input types.

The pattern attribute, when specified, is a regular expression which the input's value must match in order for the value to pass constraint validation.
