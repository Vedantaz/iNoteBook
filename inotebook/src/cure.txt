Heyyy starting it ....
1. error : export 'Switch' (imported as 'Switch') was not found in 'react-router-dom':
soln :   
If you using newer version of react-router-dom (ex. ^6.2.1 in my case) you should change <Switch> to <Routes> and use <Route> with component={<SampleComponent />} parameter.

2. error : 
Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported
soln :

# Some top answers did not work.
# export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
  And some top answers were not applicable, modifying package.json file:

# "start": "react-scripts --openssl-legacy-provider start"
  This is caused by the latest node.js V17 compatible issues with OpenSSL, see this and this issue on GitHub.

# 
To fix the dependency tree, try following the steps below in the exact order:

  1. Delete package-lock.json (not package.json!) and/or yarn.lock in your project folder.
  2. Delete node_modules in your project folder.
  3. Remove "babel-jest" from dependencies and/or devDependencies in the package.json file in your project folder.
  4. Run npm install or yarn, depending on the package manager you use.
# 
If nothing else helps, add SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to an .env file in your project.
That would permanently disable this preflight check in case you want to proceed anyway.
